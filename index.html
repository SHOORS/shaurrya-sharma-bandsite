                We push each other to be the best. It’s not
                uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs
                to be better, back to the drawing board’”
            </p>

                    The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San
                    Francisco, California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan
                    Teddy, guitarist Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
                    Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its
                    first commercial success as an unsigned act, drawing attention
                    from manager Cam Adams. Having worked with other popular
                    acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The Cat’s
                    Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even
                    further, pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.

                    From there, the band has soared, gaining international
                    recognition and ranking in the top 10 on the Poster Charts. New
                    fans immediately fell in love with the band’s original and organic
                    attitude, solidifying their place as one of the hottest and fastest
                    up and coming acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
                    themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to their candid and
                    authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to touring in
                    the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their second
                    studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
